libito
======

This project is discontinued. 

Libito was my ambitious PlayStation 2 (PS2) graphics library written first in C and then rewritten in C++. I wrote it while learning about the PS2, which meant that there were many design flaws and rewrites throughout the whole period I worked on it.

This code is unfortunately work in progress and does not utilize the true 3D capabilities of the PS2.
